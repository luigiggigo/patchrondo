# Technical review and publication preparation

Date: October 8, 2026. Scope: all Python sources, tests, examples, documentation
and metadata supplied in the project directory. No `AGENTS.md` or existing Git
repository was present in the original directories reviewed. A local, ignored
`AGENTS.md` was subsequently added during publication preparation.

## Assessment

The project is suitable for a public **alpha/MVP** release. Responsibilities are
clearly separated between the CLI, state machine, adapters, process handling,
Git and persistence. There are no Python runtime dependencies. Explicit test
consent, atomic checkpoints and the absence of automatic merges are useful
foundations.

Preparation fixes the defects below. Validation with authenticated real CLIs is
still required before promising complete compatibility or production readiness.
The MIT license already existed; this review cannot certify ownership or the
provenance of every contribution.

## Findings and fixes

| Priority | Original problem and consequence | Fix / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | `providers.py`: `--ask-for-approval` after `exec` was not supported by the installed CLI subcommand, so Codex failed before invoking the model. | Move the global flag before `exec`; check the local parser without model calls and assert the argument order in tests. |
| P1 | `providers.py`: on resume, `*.last-message.txt` could contain an earlier attempt's reply and be accepted as current output. | Delete it before each invocation and require a new final reply; test an old approval with missing new output. |
| P1 | `core.py`: review after a pause could use tests that passed before file or test-command changes. | Check file fingerprints and commands before/after review; pause with `stale_tests` and resume from tests. Cover external edits, a mutating reviewer and changed/disabled test settings. |
| P1 | `core.py`: truthy values such as `"false"` could count as consent to host test execution. | Require JSON booleans; integer settings also reject `True`; regression tests included. |
| P1 | `core.py`: a `--home` inside the repository could include private state/logs in published code. | Resolve and reject such paths before state creation and when loading configuration. |
| P1 | `core.py`: a backslash inside an f-string expression was incompatible with the advertised Python 3.11 support. | Compute the join before the f-string; parse sources using Python 3.11 grammar. |
| P2 | `core.py`: test timeouts triggered further iterations and model calls instead of pausing. | Persist the timeout result and pause; resume reruns tests without repeating development. |
| P2 | `core.py` / `report.py`: Git errors could leave state marked `running` and also prevent report generation. | Pause on Git errors/timeouts and produce a report containing the available diagnostics. |
| P2 | `core.py`: an unknown phase could loop forever; non-hashable verdict/severity values in JSON could crash the runner. | Validate phases and review field types; handle invalid reviews and cover them with tests. |
| P2 | `process.py`: `communicate()` accumulated unbounded stdout/stderr in RAM; on POSIX a child ignoring TERM could outlive its leader. | Capture to temporary files with bounded reads and retained tails; KILL the process group after TERM. Test 2 MB output and POSIX cleanup. |
| P2 | Shebang-based integration scripts could not execute on native Windows. | Invoke the same synthetic scripts through Python on Windows, preserving real subprocess execution and I/O. |
| P2 | `cli.py`: `--help` and Unicode-arrow messages failed with redirected CP1252 output on Windows. | Explicit UTF-8 CLI output and a subprocess regression test starting with CP1252 encoding. |
| P3 | The command suggested by `new` omitted a custom `--home`. | Include the state directory in the printed command. |

P1 means a blocker or a serious correctness/consent/privacy issue; P2 means a
reliability or portability issue; P3 means a usability issue.

The Codex flag's global scope is documented in the
[official CLI reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands?surface=cli).
Claude's `--restricted` requirement, version 2.1.248 or later, is confirmed by the
[official Claude reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference).
The local Codex parser check used `codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.2`; it does not certify
compatibility with every distributed CLI version.

## Repository preparation

- `.gitignore` excludes credentials, local agent state/instructions, logs, virtual environments and builds.
- `.gitattributes` normalizes text files; SPDX MIT metadata and the license are included in packages.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, issue/PR templates and a publishing guide.
- Prepared CI for Python 3.11-3.14 on Linux, macOS and Windows, with `contents: read`, official actions pinned to commits, no provider login and no automatic publication.
- Built wheel and sdist packages, checked them with Twine and smoke-tested the wheel in a separate environment.
- Added a tested heuristic publication check; no recognized credentials were found in the examined public files. This is not an exhaustive guarantee that secrets are absent.
- Translated documentation, CLI messages, task templates, generated reports and examples into English. Local `AGENTS.md` is excluded from Git and public archives/distributions.

## Validation and remaining limitations

The updated suite contains **45 tests**. Local execution on Windows with Python
3.13.3 produced **44 passing tests and 1 skipped test**, which requires POSIX
process groups. Full CI is prepared but has yet to run on GitHub. Parsing with
Python 3.11 grammar does not replace execution on a Python 3.11 interpreter.

Initial sandbox restrictions on temporary directories and Git's ownership checks
on a filesystem without ownership were addressed by running local tests with
normal temporary directories. Global Git configuration was not changed.

The remaining limitations are explicit:

1. No workflow with real Claude/Codex accounts was run. Claude is not installed in the review environment. `doctor` checks availability/login and does not guarantee flag compatibility for every release.
2. Target-project tests execute on the host. Codex can run commands allowed by its sandbox and load personal configuration. Untrusted code requires a dedicated environment.
3. Capture bounds RAM use but not disk space until timeout. Use disk quotas in isolated runners.
4. Native Windows terminates only direct children; private ACLs and stale-lock recovery do not have POSIX guarantees. WSL2 remains recommended.
5. Fingerprints exclude ignored files, submodule contents and external dependencies/services. They do not eliminate every concurrent-edit race. Avoid other writers during a task and do not run multiple `--unlock` operations simultaneously.
6. There was no original Git history to inspect. The review covers the supplied source, not other copies or external repositories.

Publishing the code as an MVP is reasonable with these limitations documented.
Commands for the first commit and push are in [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).
